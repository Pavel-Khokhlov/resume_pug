I graduated from the Marine academy and worked as a telecom engineer in Oil & Gas projects for a long time. And so I provided employers with IT support. I got acquainted with HTML, CSS and JS in 2012 year. I wrote my first application for my photography portfolio and deployed it on a host. When I moved to Moscow I worked as a photographer. I took up Frontend course at Yandex Praktikum in 2020. I am ready to implement my skills in projects. I have been studying new technologies lately to improve my knowledge. I like modern, customer-friendly apps."}
